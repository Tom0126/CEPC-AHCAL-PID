# CEPC-AHCAL-PID
Particle Identification Using Artificial Neural Network. This net is trained on Geant 4 simulation results with incident particles: electron and pion. Their energy is consistent with the particles'energy collected in 2022 CERN beam test.  

This project is run in Python 3.8, Pytorch-cuda=11.7. Be careful that in order to run these scripts, some input and output path need to be adjusted or created.
